There's a particular quality to words written by hand — something about the friction of pen on paper that slows thought down just enough to let it breathe.

I've kept notebooks for years. Not consistently, not beautifully. Some pages are half-finished lists. Others are dense blocks of feeling that I wrote at 2am and can barely read now.

## Why bother?

In a world of infinite digital capture, the notebook feels almost rebellious. It doesn't sync. It doesn't have a search function. It just *holds* things.

> "The impulse to write things down is a peculiarly compulsive one, inexplicable to those who do not share it." — Joan Didion

And maybe that's the point. Not every thought needs to be optimized or retrievable. Some thoughts just need a place to land.

## What I've learned

Three things, after years of this:

1. **Date everything.** You'll want to know when you thought what you thought.
2. **Don't reread too often.** Let the notebooks accumulate. The looking-back is better in large doses.
3. **Ugly pages are fine.** The notebook isn't a performance. It's a practice.

The best notebook is the one you actually use. Mine is a cheap composition book from the drugstore. It works perfectly.
