There's pressure, when you publish anything, to sound like you know what you're talking about. To have arrived at a conclusion. To present the polished version.

But some of the most useful things I've ever read online were written by people in the middle of figuring something out. The rough notes. The "here's what I tried and here's what broke." The honest confusion.

## The gift of "I don't know yet"

When someone writes "I'm not sure about this, but here's my current thinking," it does two things:

1. It gives others permission to also not know
2. It captures a moment of thinking that the polished version will erase

## How I try to practice this

I try to write about things I'm still learning. Not as an authority, but as a fellow traveler leaving notes on the trail.

If something here turns out to be wrong — good. That means I learned something. And maybe the correction will be useful to someone else, too.
