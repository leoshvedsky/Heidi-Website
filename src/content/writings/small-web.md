Somewhere between the algorithmic feeds and the SEO-optimized content farms, there's still a web that feels like it was made by people. For people. Without a growth strategy.

I keep finding these sites — someone's recipe collection, a researcher's reading log, a designer's portfolio that hasn't been updated since 2019 but still has the most beautiful CSS you've ever seen.

## What makes it "small"

It's not about traffic or server size. The small web is a *disposition*:

- No analytics (or if there are, nobody checks them)
- Links to friends, not sponsors
- Pages that load in under a second
- Content that exists because someone wanted to make it, not because an algorithm rewarded it

## Why it matters

Every personal website is a small act of resistance against the homogenization of the internet. You don't need a platform. You don't need permission. You just need a text editor and something to say.

This site is part of that web. Welcome.
